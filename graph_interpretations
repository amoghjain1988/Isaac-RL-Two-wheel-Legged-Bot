  Comprehensive TensorBoard Graph Interpretations

  Based on analysis of your export_tensorboard.py and the logging system, here are all the graphs generated during training:

  1. Loss Graphs

  Loss/value_function & Loss/value_function_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps (timesteps) / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Value function loss (MSE units, typically 0.001-1.0)
  - Represents: How well the critic network predicts future rewards
  - Input: mean_value_loss from PPO algorithm
  - Expected Pattern: Should decrease and stabilize during training
  - Good Range: < 0.1 indicates good value function learning

  Loss/surrogate & Loss/surrogate_vs_episodes

  - Y-axis: Policy gradient loss (typically -0.1 to 0.1)
  - Represents: PPO policy improvement objective
  - Input: mean_surrogate_loss from PPO algorithm

  - Represents: Exploration noise in action selection
  - Input: self.alg.actor_critic.std.mean()
  - Expected Pattern: Should decrease as policy becomes more confident
  - Interpretation: Higher = more exploration, lower = more exploitation

  3. Performance Graphs

  - Represents: Training simulation speed
  - Input: num_steps_per_env * num_envs / (collection_time + learn_time)
  - Expected Pattern: Should be stable, drops indicate bottlenecks
  - Interpretation: Higher FPS = faster training

  Perf/collection_time & Perf/collection_time_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Time in seconds (typically 0.1-5.0s)
  - Represents: Time to collect environment rollouts
  - Input: Time measurement during environment stepping
  - Expected Pattern: Should be consistent, spikes indicate simulation issues
  - Interpretation: Longer times = slower environment collection

  Perf/learning_time & Perf/learning_time_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Time in seconds (typically 0.1-2.0s)
  - Represents: Time for neural network updates
  - Input: Time measurement during PPO learning step
  - Expected Pattern: May increase with larger networks/batch sizes
  - Interpretation: Longer times = more compute-intensive learning

  4. Metrics Graphs

  Metrics/mean_commanded_torque & Metrics/mean_commanded_torque_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Torque in Newton-meters (typically 0-50 Nm for your robot)
  - Represents: Average torque commands sent to actuators
  - Input: torch.mean(torch.abs(robot.data.joint_effort_target))
  - Expected Pattern: Should stabilize as policy learns efficient control
  - Interpretation: Higher values = more aggressive control

  Metrics/mean_applied_torque_[actuator_name] & _vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Torque in Newton-meters (typically 0-motor_limit Nm)
  - Represents: Actual torque output after motor limits/saturation
  - Input: torch.mean(torch.abs(actuator.applied_effort)) per actuator
  - Expected Pattern: Should track commanded torque but may be clipped
  - Interpretation: Difference from commanded = motor saturation

  5. Training Graphs

  Train/mean_reward & Train/mean_reward_vs_episodes & Train/mean_reward/time

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations / Wall-clock time

  6. Episode/Curriculum Graphs

  Episode/[curriculum_name] & Episode/[curriculum_name]_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Curriculum value (varies by curriculum type)
  - Represents: Adaptive difficulty adjustments
  - Input: From infos["episode"] or infos["log"] during environment steps
  - Expected Pattern: Should adjust based on performance

  Curriculum/terrain_levels & Curriculum/terrain_levels_vs_episodes

  - X-axis: Training steps / Episode iterations
  - Y-axis: Terrain difficulty level (0.5-4.0, higher = easier)
  - Represents: Current terrain curriculum difficulty
  - Input: torch.mean(terrain.terrain_levels.float()) from terrain curriculum
  - Expected Pattern: Should start high (easy) and decrease (harder) as robot improves
  - Interpretation:
    - 3.5-4.0: Easiest terrain (mostly flat, 2cm steps)
    - 0.5-1.0: Hardest terrain (full difficulty, 13cm steps)

  Key Relationships:

  1. Steps vs Episodes: Steps = total simulation timesteps, Episodes = number of training iterations
  2. vs_time graphs: Show progress against wall-clock time instead of training steps
  3. Graph Pairs: Most metrics have both step-based and episode-based versions for different time perspectives
  4. Curriculum Adaptation: Episode info graphs show how the environment adapts difficulty based on robot performance

● The comprehensive analysis shows that your TensorBoard system generates approximately 20+ different graph types across 6 main categories. Each graph provides specific insights into different aspects of your
  robot's learning process:

  Most Important for Monitoring Training:
  - Train/mean_reward - Primary success metric
  - Loss/value_function - Learning stability
  - Curriculum/terrain_levels - Difficulty progression (confirmed: higher values = easier terrain)
  - Perf/total_fps - Training efficiency

  For Debugging:
  - Metrics/mean_commanded_torque vs Metrics/mean_applied_torque_* - Motor saturation
  - Train/mean_episode_length - Premature termination issues
  - Policy/mean_noise_std - Exploration vs exploitation balance

  Your export_tensorboard.py script automatically captures all these metrics and converts them into a comprehensive PDF report for analysis.
